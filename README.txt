Hello.

My main objective for this project was to figure out the parallax effect that is featured 
in the home page. I am not concerned about the functionality of the rest of the webstite.

I will soon be applying these effects to a project outside of school. My goal is for the 
website demonstrate how to have a dramatic, impressive, emmersive home screen for my 
other project. 

With all the current tool out in the web, there are very few things that
we need to do manually. Specific, niche effects, like the parallax one, needs to be coded
by hand. I will be able to apply this to XD in tandum with Anima, a automatic coding program.

Like many of my peers, I'm sure, I made as much as I could responsive just in good practice.
The contact page is very nice and responsive. It can collect information and it's very easy 
to understand.

The overall theme is chosen via my mood board. Almost all the colors are taken from the 
aforementioned.
